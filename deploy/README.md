# Deployment of htsget-http-lambda

This is an example that deploys htsget-http-lambda using aws-cdk. The stack is deployed as a RustFunction
using [rust.aws-cdk-lambda](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rust.aws-cdk-lambda), and integrated with aws
api gateway.

To configure htsget-http-lambda change the environment variable inside the `RustFunction` props in `htsget-http-lambda-stack.ts`, 
which changes the environment variables passed to htsget-http-lambda.

## Deploying

### Prerequisites

* [aws-cli](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) should installed and authenticated in the shell.
* Node.js and [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) should be installed.
* [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) should be installed.

After installing the basic dependencies, complete the following steps:

1. Add the arm cross-compilation target to rust.
3. Install [Zig](https://ziglang.org/) using one of the methods show in [getting started](https://ziglang.org/learn/getting-started/), or by running the commands below and following the prompts. Zig is used by cargo-lambda for cross-compilation.
2. Install [cargo-lambda](https://github.com/cargo-lambda/cargo-lambda), as it is used to compile artifacts that are uploaded to aws lambda.
4. Install [aws-cdk](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/getting_started.html) and typescript.
5. You may also need the openssl development libraries. However, these are only required for tests, and shouldn't be needed for the deployment commands listed below.
4. Install packages from the `deploy` directory and finally compile the lambda using. This should place artifacts compiled for arm64 under the `target/lambda` directory which can be deployed to AWS.

In a copy-paste nutshell, for the impatient, run the following in the `deploy` directory:

```console
npm install -g aws-cdk typescript
rustup target add aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu
cargo install cargo-lambda
npm install
cd ..
cargo lambda build --release --arm64 --bin htsget-http-lambda
cd deploy
```

After this, we're ready to deploy!

### Deploy to AWS

CDK should be bootstrapped once, if this hasn't been done before. The deployment itself can be done by checking that the stack synthesizes correctly and then deploying.

```console
cdk bootstrap
cdk synth
cdk deploy
```

Towards the end of the deployment you should get an API Gateway endpoint URL, and then one can use `awscurl` to query an endpoint like so:

```
% awscurl --region ap-southeast-2 https://<RANDOM_ID>.execute-api.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/prod/reads/service-info
{
  "id": "",
  "name": "",
  "version": "",
  "organization": {
    "name": "",
    "url": ""
  },
  "type": {
    "group": "",
    "artifact": "",
    "version": ""
  },
  "htsget": {
    "datatype": "reads",
    "formats": [
      "BAM",
      "CRAM"
    ],
    "fieldsParametersEffective": false,
    "TagsParametersEffective": false
  },
  "contactUrl": "",
  "documentationUrl": "",
  "createdAt": "",
  "UpdatedAt": "",
  "environment": ""
}
```

Note: One can pass the `--region` accordingly to `awscurl` or use `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` environment variable, but `AWS_REGION` is not honored.

### Local testing

The lambda function can also be run locally using cargo-lambda. From the root project directory, execute the following command.
```console
cargo lambda watch
```

Then in a **separate terminal session** run.
```console
cargo lambda invoke htsget-http-lambda --data-file data/events/event_get.json
```

Examples of different lambda events are located in the `data/events` directory.
