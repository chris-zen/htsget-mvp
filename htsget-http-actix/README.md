# htsget Rust server
This crate should allow to setup an [htsget](http://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/htsget.html) compliant server. For that purpose it uses the htsget-search, htsget-http-core and actix-web crates as dependencies.

## Quickstart 

To run the server:

```shell
$ cargo run -p htsget-http-actix
```

There are some examples with [curl](https://github.com/curl/curl) below. **For the examples to work, 
we assume that the server is being started from the root of
the [htsget-rs project](https://github.com/umccr/htsget-rs)**, with default settings.

There are two parts of the htsget server. The query server, which returns a list of urls, or tickets. These live on the ticket server, and they must be queried and merged to produce the final output.
By default, the ticket server runs without tls. To run the ticket server with tls, pem formatted X.509 certificates are required.

For example, to generate self-signed certificates, run:

```shell
$ openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -sha256 -days 365 -nodes -subj '/CN=localhost'
```

## Environment variables 

There are reasonable defaults to allow the user to spin up the server as fast as possible, but all of them are configurable via environment variables.

Since this service can be used in serverless environments, no `dotenv` configuration is needed, [adjusting the environment variables below prevent accidental leakage of settings and sensitive information](https://medium.com/@softprops/configuration-envy-a09584386705).

## Example cURL requests

As mentioned above, please keep in mind that the server will take the path where you executed it as base path to search for files. Here's a selection on what to ask this server for:

### GET

```shell
$ curl '127.0.0.1:8080/variants/vcf/sample1-bcbio-cancer'
```

### POST

```shell
$ curl --header "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{}' '127.0.0.1:8080/variants/vcf/sample1-bcbio-cancer'
```

### Parametrised GET

```shell
$ curl '127.0.0.1:8080/variants/vcf/sample1-bcbio-cancer?format=VCF&class=header'
```

### Parametrised POST

```shell
$ curl --header "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"format": "VCF", "regions": [{"referenceName": "chrM"}]}' '127.0.0.1:8080/variants/vcf/sample1-bcbio-cancer'
```

### Service-info

```shell
$ curl 127.0.0.1:8080/variants/service-info
```

## Running the benchmarks
There are benchmarks for the htsget-search crate and for the htsget-http-actix crate. The first ones work like normal benchmarks, but the latter ones try to compare the performance of this implementation and the [reference implementation](https://github.com/ga4gh/htsget-refserver).
There are a set of light benchmarks, and one heavy benchmark. Light benchmarks can be performed by executing:

```
cargo bench -p htsget-http-actix -- LIGHT
```

In order to run the heavy benchmark, an additional vcf file should be downloaded, and placed in the `data/vcf` directory:

```
curl ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/data_collections/1000_genomes_project/release/20190312_biallelic_SNV_and_INDEL/ALL.chr14.shapeit2_integrated_snvindels_v2a_27022019.GRCh38.phased.vcf.gz > data/vcf/internationalgenomesample.vcf.gz
```

Then to run the heavy benchmark:

```
cargo bench -p htsget-http-actix -- HEAVY
```

## Example Regular expressions
In this example 'data/' is added after the first '/'.
```shell
$ HTSGET_REGEX='(?P<group1>.*?)/(?P<group2>.*)' HTSGET_SUBSTITUTION_STRING='$group1/data/$group2' cargo run --release -p htsget-http-actix
```
