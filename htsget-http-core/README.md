Framework independent code for handling HTTP in [htsget-rs].

[htsget-rs]: https://github.com/umccr/htsget-rs

## Overview

This crate handles all the framework independent code for htsget-rs, it:
* Produces htsget-specific HTTP responses.
* Converts query results to JSON HTTP responses.
* Handles htsget client error reporting.
* Uses [htsget-search] to calculate URL tickets and byte ranges.

## Usage

### For running htsget-rs as an application

There is no need to interact with this crate for running htsget-rs.

### As a library

This crate is useful for implementing additional framework dependent versions of the htsget-rs server.
For example, htsget-rs could be written using another framework such as [warp]. This crate provides functions 
like `get_response_for_get_request`, `get_response_for_post_request` and `get_service_info_json` for this purpose.
These functions take query and endpoint information, and process it using [htsget-search] to return JSON HTTP responses.

#### Feature flags

This crate has the following features:
* `s3-storage`: used to enable `AwsS3Storage` functionality.
